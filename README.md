## About me

Hello, world! I'm Andre Cantuaria, a software developer student at MITT (Manitoba Institute of 
Trades and Technology), currently based in Winnipeg, Canada.

I'm enthusiastic about coding, always embracing the creative and visual aspects of it. 
I enjoy creating awesome websites using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and relish helping others
bring their interactive ideas to life. If you're into these techs too, let's explore them together!
